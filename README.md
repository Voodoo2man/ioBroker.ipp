## ioBroker Internet Printing Protocol Adapter

The adapter polls configured network printers using the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and publishes read-only availability, printer state, toner or ink levels, and supported page counters. It uses `Get-Printer-Attributes` over IPP/2.0; device and firmware support varies, so optional attributes may not be reported by every printer. Compatibility depends on each printer’s IPP implementation; no particular device has been verified against this implementation.

For the protocol model and attribute definitions, see [RFC 8011](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8011.html).

Node.js 22 or newer, Admin 8.2.0 or newer, and js-controller 7.2.2 or newer are required.

## Configuration

Configure polling interval and request timeout in the **Basic configuration** tab. Add and manage printers in the **Printer configuration** tab using the Device Manager. Use its **Add printer**, **Edit**, and **Remove** actions; printer cards show the configured host, live connection state, and model when reported.

Printer configurations are stored in backed-up file storage per adapter instance (for example, `ipp.0/printer-config.json`) so saving other instance settings in Admin cannot overwrite concurrent Device Manager changes. Existing `native.printers` configurations and per-instance legacy configurations stored at `ipp.0.info.printerConfig/printers.json` are migrated automatically on first startup. The former shared `ipp/printer-config.json` file is not migrated automatically because its owning instance cannot be determined safely; restore its printer list through the appropriate instance's Device Manager. Existing printers with the legacy ID `info` remain usable regardless of capitalization; new printers cannot use `info` in any capitalization.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Stable object-tree identifier; use 1-32 letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. German umlauts are transliterated (`ä` to `ae`, `ö` to `oe`, `ü` to `ue`, `ß` to `ss`). The ID cannot be changed after creation because it determines the printer's state IDs. |
| Label | Display name for the printer. |
| Host | Printer hostname or IP address without a scheme, port, credentials, path, query, fragment, or embedded whitespace. IPv6 literals must be enclosed in brackets. |
| Port | IPP port; defaults to `631`. |
| IPP resource path | Absolute resource path without `..`, whitespace, query, or fragment; defaults to `/ipp/print`. |
| Use TLS | Use IPPS over TLS. |
| Verify TLS certificate | Validate the printer's TLS certificate; disabled by default for self-signed printer certificates. |

The polling interval defaults to 60 seconds and is limited to 10 seconds through 24 hours. The request timeout defaults to 5000 ms and is limited to 500-30000 ms; it is a hard deadline for the complete request and response, including slow or incomplete responses. The adapter only sends the read-only `Get-Printer-Attributes` operation; it does not submit print jobs or change printer settings. Configure only printers that expose an IPP endpoint at the selected host, port, and resource path.

Invalid printer rows are skipped with a warning that identifies the invalid fields. Debug logging reports configured field names and value types without printing configured values.

When a printer is switched off or temporarily unreachable, the adapter marks it offline without a warning-level log; connection and timeout details are available at debug level. IPP protocol, TLS, and configuration errors remain warnings.

## States

Each configured printer gets a device with `status`, `supplies`, `counters`, and `details` channels. Supplementary numeric and boolean IPP attributes are created directly under `details` (for example, `details.printer_up_time`); attributes already represented by canonical status, model, and counter states are not duplicated. Free-form device text and structured values are omitted so printer-localized text is not published unchanged. The adapter requests all IPP attributes and creates states for returned values except explicitly excluded capabilities, verbose attribute families, and raw marker values; selected capability/default attributes are retained. Canonical lower-case attribute names made of alphanumeric segments separated by single hyphens keep their normalized IDs; other source names receive deterministic suffixes. Previously published IDs can change if a source name was non-canonical or if collision handling had assigned a numeric suffix; old detail states are cleared after a successful poll, so automations using those IDs may need updating. `status.online` is always present; `status.model`, `status.message`, and numeric `status.state` are published when supported. The complete trimmed `printer-make-and-model` value is exposed as `status.model`. Status messages use English labels derived from IPP reason keywords, including recognized `-report`, `-warning`, and `-error` suffixes, or from the canonical printer state; the device-provided `printer-state-message` is not published. The state value is `0` (`off`) while the printer is unreachable, and returns to the reported IPP state when it reconnects. Previously read measurements remain available while offline, and the last toner readings are retained if a poll does not include valid supply data. Supply names use recognized English marker color/type labels instead of raw `marker-names`; an English generic name is used when those labels are unavailable. IPP `marker-levels` are already percentage values and are used directly; optional low/high marker levels do not rescale them. Invalid, reserved, or out-of-range values are skipped, while a supply keeps its original position in the printer's marker arrays. `pages_completed`, `impressions_completed`, and `media_sheets_completed` are created only when the printer reports them. Missing counter and detail values are cleared rather than replaced with zero during successful polls, including after adapter restarts. Request details are not logged.

For supply reporting, the adapter combines each `marker-names` entry with the same-position `marker-levels` entry; recognized `marker-types` and `marker-colors` provide an English display name, while the original marker name is retained for the existing state ID. If no recognized type is available, the display name is `Supply N`. A supply is skipped if its name or percentage value is missing, invalid, or outside 0-100. Counters map from `pages-completed`, `impressions-completed`, and `media-sheets-completed` to `pages_completed`, `impressions_completed`, and `media_sheets_completed`. When reporting missing values, include the printer model and firmware, which of these IPP attributes the printer returns, and the raw values or state IDs that are absent.
